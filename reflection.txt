What components did you create?
    I created BirthdayItem.jsx, BirthdayList.jsx, MonthBirthdays.jsx, and TodayBirthdays.jsx

How did you pass props?
    I passed props by including person={person} when rendering the child component.

How did you use .map() and destructuring?
    I used .map() to loop over the array of people and destructured each person object to access name, birthday, and image directly inside the child component.
